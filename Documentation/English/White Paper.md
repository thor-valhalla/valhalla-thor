# SUMMARY OF WHAT THOR OFFERS 

## THE WORLD OF CRYPTONS,SUMMARY 2017
The world of cryptocurrencies has appeared stronger than ever in this past year 2017.

The market for cryptocurrencies and the investments that surround it have become widely known and have been echoed in numerous media around the world.

This situation has attracted large investors who have not only generated a large
growth, but also have created a massive impact on the quotes with very steep drops.

The BITCOIN and the Altcoins have been the object of criticism and support, from detractors and defenders, who with their interests have affected this incredible project of the future called Blockchain.
 
## HANDLING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS
Large investors in financial markets use "manipulation" strategies to catch the dough and thus be able to buy at the best possible price and undo their positions at the best price.

In financial markets, this is relatively easy and logical.
 
Due to the limitation of the size of your account, you can not immediately move all your capital because it would affect your profitability. Therefore, they use maneuvers such as false breaks, false tests, breaks of supports and resistances that the mass believed were solid and sudden reactions in areas of imbalance. The question is

Why do not they do the same with cryptocurrencies?

## ADVANTAGES OF INVESTMENT IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES
Institutional traders, banks and large investors compete against each other, and that leads to their maneuvers have to be more subtle, but, the cryptocurrency market is mostly driven by people with little knowledge in investment, due to the ease of entering in this market and the great benefits that entail.

That is if I buy 1 contract in the future of oil and the price goes against me, automatically with each Tick (The minimum movement that has the price in this market) will subtract the amount of money proportional to my account.

In the cryptocurrency market that scenario does not happen, when the price goes against me, my investment is devalued.

This small difference can allow me to hold my position much more than in the stock market because my account is not affected by a direct subtraction, only the investment is affected.

However, we must understand that investments in cryptocurrencies can be a high-risk investment in which we can lose all the capital we have.

## BLOCKCHAIN ADAPTATION & BENEFIT
But despite all these factors, the Blockchain system and cryptocurrencies are here to stay.

The big investors, banks, and governments have no choice but to adapt to them, but let's not forget that they also want to continue earning money.

## MARKET OPERATION
Why do not they do the same manipulations that are used in the financial markets?

The answer is simple; there are 3 types of analysis for us, TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (Indicators, price interpretation, patterns, supports, etc.), FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS (News) and DISCRETIONAL ANALYSIS (It is the interpretation in probabilities of the previous two).

The cryptocurrencies are practically governed according to our studies of the last two years in a 90% fundamental analysis and a 10% technical analysis... And this is where the game begins.

What would happen if a large investment firm or public figure said that cryptocurrencies are a scam? What would happen (and happens) is that it creates a great panic vendor which they take advantage of to buy at better prices.

That means that we must always have a well-defined strategy for these cases, for example, a simple hacking of an official Twitter account of a cryptocurrency, writing false news can create a massive seller panic that allows you to buy at the best available price or sell it highest possible


## CONCLUSION & FUTURE

The Blockchain system is the future; we consider that calling it the second internet, it does not see all the great potential that it has, we are witnessing the beginning of a new era in which the financial system that has lasted so long, will wither away little by little.

The applications in infrastructure and services are so many that they even seem overwhelming.

The transparency and immutability of the code can bring us closer to what we might consider a utopia.


# THE GROWTH OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES

## BITCOIN GROWTH

In the first figure, we observe the growth of Bitcoin during 2017. The growth was 1500%, and its maximum point was 2000%.

## GROWTH CAPITALIZATION CRYPTOCURRENCIES
In the first figure, we observe the growth of capitalization during 2017. The growth was 3400%, and its maximum point was 3700%.

# LEARNING PLATFORM

Investments in cryptocurrencies carry a risk, equal to or higher than the negotiation of any underlying in the stock market, therefore, not as advisory or advice, but as a collection of our experience of almost six years in financial markets and nearly two years in cryptocurrencies. We will make available to anyone interested in this world and completely free, on our website, a complete basic guide on how to read, interpret and manage the investments of your cryptocurrencies.

A significant differentiator in our investment guide is the importance and relevance we give to the psychological and emotional management, which without neglecting something as crucial as technical or fundamental analysis, allows us to deal with the vendor panic and high volatility, with greater control and efficiency.

## INVEST FIRST IN YOUR LEARNING
Finally, the THOR team will launch updates to increase the knowledge and analysis capacity, financial and psychological management of our community and people interested in learning more about the financial world.

In addition to all of the above, we will provide links to videos and channels on Twitter, steem, medium and channels of information that not only create a reaction in the market for being influencers, but also keep your community informed of the day to day cryptocurrencies and futures plans that are already quoted in the market.

Without forgetting the most interesting ICO's that are to come, which we can make a Hold in the earliest stage of the coin.


# OFFER OF TOKENS

## QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION
The attractive offer of THOR gives the opportunity to negotiate a currency with enormous growth possibilities due to its scarcity and management of inflation.

We care about our community and to affect as little as possible the devaluation of this, but give the opportunity to improve positions and get more followers for this exciting project; we will provide quarterly 10,000 coins in 2 periods per quarter.

On a quarterly basis, exchanges and exchange houses will be updated where THOR can be acquired, increasing the presence and notoriety in the cryptocurrency space.

# SPEND THOR IN THE REAL WORLD

The blockchain system is not only the future, but it is an open the door to speculation in the markets, with fewer complications than the stock market.

But, one of the complications that we have to face in this space is the one of,

How to use this benefit without selling my tokens?

This is where THOR and other cryptocurrencies facilitate the answer to this problem.

Thanks to the payment cards that we will negotiate with several companies of great worldwide recognition, the holders of these will be able to buy goods and services with the same ease as their FIAT money cards.

# HOLDERS & COMMUNITY

## QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION
Our vision in the short and medium term is to create a community with different types of coins to perform functions that only one and universal could not. Therefore, we will reward Holders and loyal followers with the possibility of entering the presale of our main currency and the following projects.

# BASES, OBJECTIVES & PLANS

## PROJECT BASES

* CFD'S, FOREX & FUTURES
* 6 years of experience, in intraday trading in futures markets & Forex

## BLOCKCHAIN & CRYPTOCURRENCIES
* 2 years of analysis, studies and investments in cryptocurrencies, day trading and long-term investments.

# CRYPTOCURRENCIES CONTENT

## ADVISORY

## PORTFOLIOS

## DAILY CONTENT
Creating articles and regular content with the latest news and news from Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.

## OBJECTIVES & PLANS
Before December 31, 2018, THOR will be consolidated with a strong community that will be able to enjoy all the advantages it offers.

THOR will be positioned in the Top 100 of cryptocurrencies and will be the beginning of a congregation of high-level projects.


# ETHEREUM NETWORK
As THOR is born from the Ethereum network, we will give a brief explanation of what this cryptocurrency is so pioneering and how smart contracts and the main functionalities of the Blockchain Ethereum act.

# SMART CONTRACTS
The smart contracts are the digitalization of the end of the intermediaries, the end of the contracts subject "to interpretation." We are witnessing a new era in which who decides if the contract is fulfilled and under what conditions, is a code.

The code is neutral and only obeys the established parameters, therefore simplifies processes, saves money to consumers and eliminates intermediaries.

*"CONTRACTS CAN BE GENERATED BY PHYSICAL PERSONS, LEGAL STATES,
MACHINES & PROGRAMS "*


#  SMART CONTRACTS
What they are, and what they can do for us in our day to day
Contracts can be generated by individuals, legal entities, machines, programs...

All this gives us a small vision of how useful and incredibly extensive its use can be.

They do not depend on a centralized higher body such as a company, a legal or governmental authority.

They are transparent; anyone can access them (imagine a government managed by smart contracts).

The uses vary from a resolution of a bet among friends to a testament that would be executed at the time of death, to a considerable saving of time and money in infrastructure management.

It is also true that it is a young technology with limitations (at the moment), but it is now the beginning of a world revolution as we know it. Welcome to the future

*"Decentralization and Transparency"*

# ETHEREUM NETWORK THAT MAKES?

Ethereum allows consumers and developers to use their platform, is open source, decentralized and allows the creation and use of smart contracts.

## MIST
It is the official wallet of Ethereum, as it can be My Ether Wallet, they are wallets where we can have absolute control over our security keys, unlike exchanges that if they are hacked can steal our tokens, with Mist and other wallets, they need our private keys to access them.

## WHAT THE DECENTRALIZED NETWORKS DO 
Decentralized networks redistribute control and powers away from a centralized server allowing communication between P2P peers.

This happens in the chain of blocks allowing users to reach agreements between them without the need for a central authority.


## ETHER
It is the Ethereum token; it is the method of payment of your transactions and also the reward for users who contribute their resources to facilitate operations in the Ethereum network

## WHAT USES HAVE IT?
Centralized services through the Ethereum network allows it to be decentralized, thus eliminating intermediaries, Which entails a reduction of costs and commissions.

Thanks to this network, we can also create new tokens based on it, which can perform functions as complex as the capacity and imagination that the developers allow them.

# GLOBALIZING DECENTRALIZATION
## IDEOLOGY

For the THOR team, the Blockchain system created by Satoshi Nakamoto or the group of people behind its creation... Is an ideal, it is the digitalization of a more transparent world, of a society in which the trust and truthfulness of the information are the most important to validate any action that is carried out in the Blockchain system.

We are talking about a purchase or sale, a contract, a patent, clean energy at an affordable price, a system of unmanipulated information channels, it is possible.

## FUTURE

With this revolution the world in a few years will change a lot, but to better, there will come a time when the person or group of people who have more money in the world, will not be those who control and manage it, the day will come in that the abusive business of banks and intermediaries will end.

We are talking about a system that is implemented in governments and companies, the embezzlement and theft of high society and people with a political position would be history, being a company with public accounts and audited by anyone who wants to explore the management and movements that have been made.

We do not know how far this technology will go because it is very young, but we know that it is time for all people to be masters of our destiny and not slaves of a society controlled by the elite.

# ECONOMIC INTEREST
## WHY IS THIS WORLD INTERESTING FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW?

* When we have a token, if the quote of this low, does not mean a subtraction in our account but a devaluation of the investment
* Start phase of the world of cryptocurrencies
* Projection of future capitalization
