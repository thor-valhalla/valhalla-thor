#SIMPLIFYING CRYPTOCURRENCIES

##THOR

THOR was born with the aim of simplifying cryptocurrencies; it is created from the Ethereum.THOR network will facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies creating a wallet and a wallet app in which they can store and manage the tokens that our users own and thus link them directly to debit cards to be able to buy goods and services with the main payment cryptocurrencies as well as being able to make low-cost transfers to any THOR wallet in the world.
To open the possibility of investing in cryptocurrencies to a more extensive public, the THOR team will create an entirely free essential guide to learn how to invest and develop their strategies. Finally, one of the most attractive features of THOR is its supply of 100,000 Tokens, which will be strategically distributed to little affect the price at which it is quoted but still give the opportunity to enter new investors and improve the positions of the holders.
